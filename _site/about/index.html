<p>Jeliuu.cc is the name of this site created by me to record:</p>

<ul>
  <li>my (trivial) life</li>
  <li>my (naive) thoughts</li>
  <li>my (personal) stereotypes and prejudices</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast with what I say in the tangible reality, only my <em>real fealings</em> are posted here. So Jeliuu.cc can also be seen as the “honest side” of myself.</p>

<p>Topics range from eating to artificial intelligence. Kind of ridiculous, I agree :)</p>

<h3 id="jian-liu-myself">Jian Liu (Myself)</h3>

<p>My name is <em>Jian Liu</em>, first year Ph.D student at CASIA (Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences).</p>

<p>I am a Chinese traditional conseved man with the character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP">INTP</a>. As it’s described in wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. Their weaknesses include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties, and a tendency to get lost in abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listening music</li>
  <li>Running</li>
  <li>Thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>My major is Natural Language Processing (abbreviated as NLP), a tough but active research area. Sometimes, I must acknowlege that NLP (especially math behind it) is too difficult to learn, and a bunch of aspects are really beyond my understanding.</p>

<p>Anyway, through the tough learning, I except figuring out all the <em>magic</em> underhood, and a deeper understanding about math, language, or even, the running mechanism of the artificial world.</p>
