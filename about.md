### Jeliuu.cc

Jeliuu.cc is the name of this site created by me to record:

* my (trivial) life
* my (naive) thoughts
* my (personal) stereotypes and prejudices

In contrast with what I say in tangible reality, only my *real fealings* are posted here. So Jeliuu.cc can also be regarded as the "honest side" of myself. 

Topics range from eating to artificial intelligence. Kind of ridiculous, I agree :)


### Jian Liu (Myself)

My name is *Jian Liu*, first year Ph.D student at CASIA (Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences).

I am a Chinese traditional conseved man with the character of [INTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP). As it's described in wikipedia:

> INTPs are marked by a quiet, stoic, modest, and aloof exterior that masks strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. Their weaknesses include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties, and a tendency to get lost in abstractions.

My interests are:

* reading 
* sketch 
* jogging
* thinking

Now, I am studying Natural Language Processing (abbreviated as NLP), a tough but active research area. Sometimes, I must acknowlege that NLP (especially math behind it) is too difficult for me, and a bunch of aspects are really beyond my understanding.

Anyway, through the tough learning, I will figure out all the *magic* underhood, and expect a deeper understanding about math, language, or even, the running mechanism of the artificial world.
